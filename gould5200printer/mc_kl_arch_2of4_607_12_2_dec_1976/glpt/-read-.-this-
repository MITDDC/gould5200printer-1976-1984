THIS DIRECTORY EXISTS FOR SPOOLING FILES TO A REMOTE GRAPHICS PRINTER
(CURRENTLY THE GOULD 5200 IN BLDG. 38.).  IT MOSTLY CONTAINS MAIL
TO THE FILE PROCESSING PROGRAM AND SPOOLED PROCESSED FILES FOR
THE UNSPOOLER.  THE SPOOLING PROGRAM WILL (HOPEFULLY) BE CLEVER ABOUT
NOT PROCESSING AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF DATA IF THE UNSPOOLER OR
THE PRINTER ARE NOT ACTIVE.
