1] Commonly used fonts are now kept in the right format on .GLPT.;  You
can add your favorite font to by putting its name in .GLPT.;GLDFNT
FONTS.
2] The positioning of plots is now determined by BOTMAR and LFTMAR
(default values 150.).  These give the position of [0,0] on the
Tektronix screen from the bottom and left sides of the paper (looking at
the paper the rigth way up).
3] The default orientation of plots is determined by DEF-ARDS-ROT;  this
should be bound to 3 for output to the XGP.

first source file's worth (8 pages), the tail sheet came
out.  it claimed that 1 page was bad.  subsequent files didn't
come out on the printer, although the unspooler sent them and deleted
the [glpt] files (i thought this wasn't supposed to happen any more).
in the meanwhile the 11 died a couple of times, and the boot loader

SLOW THAT THERE IS NO VISIBLE DEGRADATION OF SPEED OF THE TEKTRONIX
