OK now.  GLS explained to me a more or less winning way
to do things.  I misinterpreted his original instructions.
So Spoolr need not have the TTY open (does it really matter?).
To re-open:
a/ ttyifa
call 1,q$open$x
a/ ttyofa
call 1,q$open$x
bb$x
At present, there seems to be a bug so that in the read-eval-print
loop, Lisp forgets to Terpri after printing, but that's minor.
