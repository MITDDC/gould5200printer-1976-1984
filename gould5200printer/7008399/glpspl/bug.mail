What does it mean when the spooler goes to sleep
for an extended time in the middle of processing a file?

    Error occurred while trying to queue your output for the XGP (probably
      due to AI going down or AI: device lossage).
      You must queue your output manually when AI: is revived.
      See the XGP node under :INFO GLP for more details.

I've been getting alot of these lately when trying to use automatic plot spooling
from MACSYMA's PLOT2 facility.  Roughly 40% of my plots (which I am trying to
send to the XGP from MC, by the way) get zapped by this, even when AI 
and the XGP are both up and not heavily loaded.  Maybe this indicates a bug
in the GLP spooler?  By the way, :INFO GLP does not give enough information
to let an ITS novice such as myself figure out where the lost plots are and
how to get them to the XGP spooler in one piece.  Perhaps a separate INFO
menu entry for GLP for this one issue could be set up and the error message
could point to it explicitly.    - Phil

The reason your category shows as "O" is that the Gould Spooler
actually does the queueing of the plot to the XPG(having processing
it itself).  Undoubtedly the Gould Spooler could be hacked to 
figure out the correct category appropriate to the person
originally doing the plot.  However I would regard it as a waste
of someone's time to make this fix.  (The plots all go in Queue 1
whatever your category.)  Please understand that no insult is
intended by categorizing you as "non-human".
[Gould-hackers:  Maybe the default category could be changed to "U"
for plots?]

I was trying to use :glp ... /output:xgp and since the GLP is being
serviced it just queued my request rather than send it to the xgp.
Clearly using :glp to xgp files should not be affected by the state
of the gould printer?

The next version of DDT will not have GLP^F set the default device.

glp^F sets the default dev for :print etc.
It shouldn't.  (cf. xgp^F and TTY^F)

The thing which sends network error

The indentation on the glp is better now, there is some.  But I think that
there is a problem in the algorithm  I believe tabs in the first column
position to column 9 rather than 8.  My emacs text still doesnt look like my
glp output.

The :glp foo command will not expand tabs into the proper number of spaces
before printing.  Shouln't it?

1) Although the doc in info gives an example of NOHEADER, it does not specify
it in the list of options.

2)The abort command does not work as documented.  It did not ask me if I
really wanted to abort the current thing being printed, it just did so.  Also,
one time I used it, I caused the GLP spooler to stop.
