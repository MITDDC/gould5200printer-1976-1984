The LPT (line printer) mode on the GOULD now works in the new program.
You get this by :GTPL <file>/H
where <file> is a file specification.  It is recommended that this
form be used for large outputs of data or long programs, as it will
print much faster than the XGP simulation mode.  There are several
new features with /H.  First, page numbering is now done as the
default.  To turn off page numbering, use /H[N].  Also, FORTRAN
lisings (with printer control commands in column 1) can be
printed using /H[F].  In FORTRAN mode,  page numbering is normally
turned off.  It get it turned back on, use /H[F L].
Note, in the above, FORTRAN, FORT, FTN, or FOR can be used instead of
F and LIST or LISTING can be used instead of L.
Several other options exist which will be documented under :INFO GTPL
(line truncation, treatment of control chars, page heading specification,
etc.)
