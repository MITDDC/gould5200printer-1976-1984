I was trying to use :glp ... /output:xgp and since the GLP is being
serviced it just queued my request rather than send it to the xgp.
Clearly using :glp to xgp files should not be affected by the state
of the gould printer?

The next version of DDT will not have GLP^F set the default device.

glp^F sets the default dev for :print etc.
It shouldn't.  (cf. xgp^F and TTY^F)

The thing which sends network error
commands to the user should preface it by an explanation.

The indentation on the glp is better now, there is some.  But I think that
there is a problem in the algorithm  I believe tabs in the first column
position to column 9 rather than 8.  My emacs text still doesnt look like my
glp output.

The :glp foo command will not expand tabs into the proper number of spaces
before printing.  Shouln't it?

1) Although the doc in info gives an example of NOHEADER, it does not specify
it in the list of options.

2)The abort command does not work as documented.  It did not ask me if I
really wanted to abort the current thing being printed, it just did so.  Also,
one time I used it, I caused the GLP spooler to stop.

Why does GLP fail to load MC:R;12TR KST?
