this dir keeps accumulating scn files. has someone frobbed the program
so the files forget to be deleted, or is the glp (or equivalent device)
down and the program queues the files instead of rejecting them? they
are eating up a hell of a lot of disk space on both ai and mc, space
which can't afford to be eaten up in this fashion.
(most of the scan files seem oto be ones queued the day i see them, and
are thus not backed up. doe this maybe have anything to do with the problem?)

Seems the GLP locks down core while it is in the SLEEP state.
Truly bogus.

I put in an end-of-processing hook for Versatec output
in GLPSPL;GLPSPL.  Recompiled, redumped, updated LISP;LOCK >.
OK?

GLPSPL is evidently in the wrong lisp. It shares 0 blocks right now.

The problem is that the resolution of the XGP is slightly
different in the horiz and vertical directions.  (One
is 192/inch and the other is 200/inch.  I forget which is
which.  Actually the horiz resolution is NOT constant across
the page, as you may have noticed.)  There is no provision
is PLOT2 for allowing for this difference (partly to maintain
an easy conversion between plots produced for the XGP, Gould
printer (which has the same vert. and horiz. resolutions)
and Tektronixes).  As a temporary fix I suggest you manually
adjust the WINDOW and XMAX etc. to give yourself the scaling
you want.  The best place to make a more permanent fix would
be in the Gould spooler (which is the program that produces
the  scan files for the XGP).  There is already a provision
in the spooler for blowing up a plot by a constant scale
factor (PLOTSCALE, I believe it's called).  So it shouldn't
be too difficult to make the scales different in the two
directions.
