In order that we be able to use the new TELNET, the BREAK key function has
been changed.  To reset the allocation for your terminal (i.e. unhang it)
you now type TOP ESC  (that is, type the ESC key while holding down TOP).
To restart the PDP-11 type Control Top ESC.  Note, restarting the PDP-11
this way should be done cautiously, as it can cause the PDP-11 to crash
(particularly if the GOULD is printing at the time).

We should probably have a hack for the GTV's so that the origin for
writing characters changes periodically to make the phosphor on the monitors
wear more uniformly (i.e. move the origin up or down 1-2 raster lines).

If you happen to notice the Ann Arbor losing again (with cursor posing losing)
hardwarewise, try checking that the cables between the AA's and the PDP-11 are
plugged in correctly.  That was the problem this morning and the symptoms were
identical to those we had once before (it was my fault this time...)

Correct way to set the speed to 40K on the Imlac line is

To find out the status of the GOULD's spooler and unspooler programs,
you can now do 
:P ;JGLPTR
and you will see the status display for the job tree of the spooler and
unspooler.  If you see your own job tree instead, this means that no
unspooler or spooler exists, so do 
:SPOOLR
:UNSPLR
If you do not see a job with a UNAME of GLPTR and a JNAME or SNAME of SPOOLR,
then do :SPOOLR
If you do not see a job with a UNAME of GLPTR and a JNAME or SNAME of UNSPLR,
then do :UNSPLR

Another common problem is that the PDP-11 accidently logs itself in
on T23.  If you do TTY and see
T23  ___0nn ...   rather than
D23  GLPT-U ...  then gun down the HACTRN on T23.
Hopefully this problem will not occur as frequently when the next ITS
is released.

DEFAULT FILE CHANGES:
R11MUX 200 is the most recent version of R11MUY and seems to work ok.
R11MUX BIN, LIST have been updated accordingly.
GLPT;TTY RESET now applies to the new program only.  TTY ORESET applies
to the pre-TV version.  To go from the old to the new, XFILE the file
TTY FIX.  To go from the new back to the old program, XFILE TTY ORESET.
TTY RESET should only be used when I.T.S. initially comes up.
The loader how knows about N11LOD which loads RTTY11;RTTY11 >.
O11LOD loads RTTY11;RTTY11 <.  R11LOD loads RTTY11;RTTY11 LOAD.

While the Gould is done, don't forget about the Tektronix copier.
It has new paper in it and is producing reasonable copies.  Don't
forget to let it warm up (for 5-10 minutes), and to switch it off
after you've finished.  The first copy often gets stuck;  just
open up the metal plate inside the machine and remove the stuck
piece of paper and try again.

PLDRW;CBLBOX WIRING describes the cable box (per office) wiring.
PLDRW;BLDG26 CABLE describes the cable to 26-209 (Coppi's group)
PLDRW;BLDG38 CABLE describes the cable between MC and 38-246.

PLDRW should be used from now on as a central place for all
hardware documentation for our group.  Also, these files will
be listed and put in the file drawer in the computer room.
I will also move the IMLAC hardware documentation over to
that directory (or make links).

Yes there is a spooler for the Gould and it understands XGP commands.
We are currently using the Gould in two modes:
1]  One that utilizes the hardware font in the Gould.  It then looks
much like a lineprinter (I think the vertical and horizontal heights
are both the same as a standard lineprinter), although the paper
comes out as single sheets, so double title pages are unnecessary.
This is called by :GTPL <file-spec>/H
2]  One that exactly mimics the XGP (uses the same fonts, XGP commands
etc).  This is called by :GTPL <file-spec>
For both modes an additional /K flag will delete <file-spec>.  If you
like you can set things going using the Mailer, since :GTPL <text>
is equivalent to :MAIL GLPTR
_<text><cr>^C
(Most long listing we get in the Hardware font since this is many times
quicker.  However both modes would be nice to have from @.)

Does the GLPT understand XGP commands?
Is there a spooler for it?
If so, I am willing to make /X[GLPT] for @.

It seems as if your description of the various devices would be a bit
clearer if you distinguished what people have to know in the normal
course of operation (e.g. how to turn on the devices and type various
characters) vs. what has to be done to get things back in their default
state (re-loading the 11, setting the speeds of the terminals).  If 
there were strong encouragement to leave the terminals in their default
state (e.g. anyone who wants to dial up somewhere at 300 baud should
normally reset things after he's finished), then the latter part of the
documentation could be relegated to an appendix, and most people
wouldn't have to concern themselves with it.

To: PLASMA-GROUP at MIT-MC
When you change the paper in the Gould, please check the water level
in the plastic box in paper well.  This should be at least 1/2 full of
water.  Top it up with my watering can, if it's not.  (The purpose of
this is to keep the paper slightly humid.  If it dries out the
quality of the printing goes down.)  Bug MACRAK to finish documenting 
the hardware if you want to find out how to change the paper.

Half the problems with the Gould are traceable to the fact that the
paper has gone dry.  It is imperative to keep the water dish in the
Gould sufficiently full.  The water should be completely changed
periodically (once a week/fortnight?) and the wick replaced.
