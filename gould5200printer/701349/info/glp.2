The GLP spooling system allows  queuing to the Gould Printer in 38-244
on the main M.I.T. campus.  It is also possible to see the list of all
pending requests.

Using GLP is very similar to using the XGP spooler so it is
assumed the reader is familiar with running :XGP in DDT.  If
you are not, type a P to get back to the documentation on
XGP and read that first.  Only the differences between :GLP
and :XGP are described here. 

To see the status of the Gould queue, do GLP^F in DDT.
(This is provides information just like XGP^F *note status:(XGP)STATUS.)

Basic File Printing

The GLP queuer accepts file commands, which specify a file to be
printed and optionally a font to be used.  The general form is:

	:GLP [;file-command][file-specification][_ fonts-spec-list]

for instance,
	:GLP USERS;MY MAIL_25FR

would print the file DSK:USERS;MY MAIL in a type font called 25FR
(note the [;file-command] has been ommitted in this case).

A file command is usually either ;PRINT or ;LIST (if it is not specified
it defaults to ;LIST - this is different from the XGP where the default
is ;PRINT).  In addition, however, GLP has several file commands which
are not used with :XGP, namely, ;LPT, ;ARDS, ;DPLT, ;IMAGE, and ;TEK.
All but the first of these will be discussed in the next section.
Several XGP file commands are not supported, including ;THESIS (there
are no thesis forms for the Gould),  ;PLOT (use ;DPLT instead), ;TEST
(you probably don't care about this).  ;SAMPLE is supported, and ;SCAN
may be supported someday.

	;LPT - This is used when you want a high speed line printer
	       type listing.  This is recommended for all temporary
	       or lengthy listings of programs, or other unformatted
	       text.  In addition to being processed much faster,
	       this type of listing tends to come out with better
	       quality.
;;; add note about switches here for FORTRAN, page headings,wraparound, etc.
;;; ;HW, ;SIZE, etc.
