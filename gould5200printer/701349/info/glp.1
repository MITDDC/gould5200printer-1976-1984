The GLP spooling system allows queueing to the Gould Printer in 38-244
on the main M.I.T. campus.  It is also possible to see the list of all
pending requests.

Using GLP is very similar to using the XGP spooler so it is
assumed the reader is familiar with running :XGP in DDT.  If
you are not, type a P to get back to the documentation on
XGP and read that first.  Only the differences between :GLP
and :XGP are described here. 

To see the status of the Gould queue, do GLP^F in DDT.
(This is provides information just like XGP^F *note status:(XGP)STATUS.)
